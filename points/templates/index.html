<h1> Champlain Cup Standings</h1>
<strong>How points are calculated:</strong>
<ul><li>Every participant in every event earns one participation point.</li>
<li>In events limited by age, gender, or division, or events with rating caps of D or less:
    <ul>
    <li>2 additional points to first place, one additional point to second place.</li>
    </ul></li>
<li>In all other events:
    <ul>
    <li>The top 80% of placed fencers earn bonus points.</li>
    <li>Each place earns one bonus point less than the next higher place.</li>
    <li>First Place bonus depends on the strength of the event:
    <ul>
        <li>A4, A3, B3: 32 points</li>
        <li>A2, B2, C3: 24 points</li>
